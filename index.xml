      <description>Author: Roger Grosse
Intended: I wanted to save this post for my own read-list but it was interesting enough to post here. I am not the original author. Here is the original link.
Description: An overview of several uses of differential geometry ideas in machine learning.
In machine learning, we&amp;rsquo;re often interested in learning a function or a distribution that we can use to making predictions. In order to learn and apply such a function or distribution, we need to somehow represent it, i.</description>

      <title>Enemies of feature visualisation: High frequency distortions</title>

      <description>First understand how feature visualisation works:
Essentialy we choose a random image and iteratively optimise it so that a specific neuron is fired.
STEPS:
 Choose a neuron whose activation you want to visualise. Initialise a random image Forward propagate: Get the output of the random image at that neuron: We want to maximise this: Our cost function Back-propagate on it using Gradient Ascent: Find the gradient with respect to input, add this to the input  Note: in gradient descent&amp;gt; we subtract the gradient from weights during backpropagation.</description>

      <description>A random calming image to show I have no experience in writing content  They said the hardest part of the flight is taking off. Guess we’ll never know if we don’t go to the runway.
And why did I decide to start a blog post on machine learning when there is literally a million listed, authentic resources out there all over YouTube and MOOC websites. That is exactly the reason why.</description>

      <description>This page contains a list of major projects I have done after 2021, most of which have been in Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Communication topics, etc. Each entry has a brief description of the project like the tech stack used and so on. The links to individual project pages will be included later; The list will grow with time!
Information Flow Across Neural Network Layers   This project aims to decode the black box nature of neural networks and provide insights on how information is processed over the layers of a network based on many metrics such as information capacity.</description>

      <title>Introduction to K-Means</title>

      <description>This tutorial assumes some familiarity with basic principles of machine learning, the math and code can be developed on the way.
Machine Learning Learning can be Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforced and Semi-supervised.
 Reinforcement Learning: Learning with a critic, critic may be wrong at times, maybe stochastic, but different from supervisor in case of supervised learning. Supervisor gives feedback, critic only says yes or no.
 K-Means algorithm:  K as a parameter distance threshold as a parameter  K means crisp decision boundary: grading, fingerprint ROI(Region of Interest)</description>

      <title>Practical Guide On Training Custom Yolo V3 Model</title>

      <description>Darknet Logo  The YOLO architecture is very similar to any conventional CNN, but training YOLO from scratch for custom images is still a mystery for many. One of the reasons is the initial training dataset problem, we have to annotate each image for its bounding boxes. Then modify the configuration file according to the number of classes we are training for. This tutorial is the best for those who want to start out on YOLO without much coding experience or even knowledge of convolutional neural networks.</description>

      <description>Hello visitor, I am Dibyajyoti Jena, working my way to stay away from Roko&amp;rsquo;s Basilisk.
I am now pursuing a masters in Communication Engineering from IIT Delhi.
My undergrad was from IIIT Bhubaneswar, India, in Electronics and Communication (2021).
On the lookout for employment opportunities/internships in the mixed fields of machine learning, deep learning or signal processing and communication. Any future employers are welcome drop a mail at dibyajyotijena47@gmail.com.
Listed below are a few of the skills I have acquired over the years:</description>

      <description>This is official post one. We will include some code here, syntax highlighting etc.
Trying out changes to see if I am comfortable with uploading live changes to github.

      <description>Ok this is the first post, lets see if we can include some math here lol
$$ (1 + 1)^2 = 4 $$
Heading one I like Bold Text.
$$f(k) = {n \choose k} p^{k} (1-p)^{n-k}$$
\begin{equation} \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp;amp; x^1_0 &amp;amp; x^2_0 &amp;amp; \cdots &amp;amp; x^{degree}_0 \\ 1 &amp;amp; x^1_1 &amp;amp; x^2_1 &amp;amp; \cdots &amp;amp; x^{degree}_1 \\ \vdots &amp;amp; \vdots &amp;amp; \vdots &amp;amp; \ddots &amp;amp; \vdots \\ 1 &amp;amp; x^1_n &amp;amp; x^2_n &amp;amp; \cdots &amp;amp; x^{degree}_n \\ \end{pmatrix} \end{equation} \begin{equation} \frac{a}{b} \end{equation}</description>
