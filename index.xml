      <description>This tutorial assumes some familiarity with basic principles of machine learning, the math and code can be developed on the way.
Machine Learning Learning can be Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforced and Semi-supervised.
 Reinforcement Learning: Learning with a critic, critic may be wrong at times, maybe stochastic, but different from supervisor in case of supervised learning. Supervisor gives feedback, critic only says yes or no.
 K-Means algorithm:  K as a parameter distance threshold as a parameter  K means crisp decision boundary: grading, fingerprint ROI(Region of Interest)</description>

      <description>Darknet Logo  The YOLO architecture is very similar to any conventional CNN, but training YOLO from scratch for custom images is still a mystery for many. One of the reasons is the initial training dataset problem, we have to annotate each image for its bounding boxes. Then modify the configuration file according to the number of classes we are training for. This tutorial is the best for those who want to start out on YOLO without much coding experience or even knowledge of convolutional neural networks.</description>

      <description>Hello visitor, I am Dibyajyoti Jena, working my way to stay away from Roko&amp;rsquo;s Basilisk.
My undergrad was from IIIT Bhubaneswar, India, in Electronics and Communication (2021), where I learnt my love for good code. I am now pursuing a masters in Communication Engineering.
On the lookout for employment opportunities/internships in the mixed fields of machine learning, deep learning or signal processing and communication. Any future employers are welcome drop a mail at dibyajyotijena47@gmail.</description>

      <description>This is official post one. We will include some code here, syntax highlighting etc.
Trying out changes to see if I am comfortable with uploading live changes to github.
Try a youtube video embedding:

      <description>Ok this is the first post, lets see if we can include some math here lol
$$ (1 + 1)^2 = 4 $$
Heading one I like Bold Text.
\begin{equation} \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp;amp; x^1_0 &amp;amp; x^2_0 &amp;amp; \cdots &amp;amp; x^{degree}_0 \\ 1 &amp;amp; x^1_1 &amp;amp; x^2_1 &amp;amp; \cdots &amp;amp; x^{degree}_1 \\ \vdots &amp;amp; \vdots &amp;amp; \vdots &amp;amp; \ddots &amp;amp; \vdots \\ 1 &amp;amp; x^1_n &amp;amp; x^2_n &amp;amp; \cdots &amp;amp; x^{degree}_n \\ \end{pmatrix} \end{equation} \begin{equation} \frac{a}{b} \end{equation}</description>
